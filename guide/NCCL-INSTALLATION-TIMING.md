# NCCL Installation Timing Analysis

## Summary

**Total Estimated Time: 10-15 minutes on HeadNode (m5.8xlarge)**

This is why NCCL installation is **NOT** included in automatic CustomActions - it would significantly delay cluster creation.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Phase 1: Download & Clone (Measured)

| Step | Time | Size | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------|
| Download postinstall script | ~1s | 2KB | Fast |
| Clone NCCL repo (v2.28.7-1) | **2s** | 6.9MB | 114 source files |
| Clone NCCL tests (v2.16.9) | **1s** | 372KB | 15 test files |
| Clone AWS OFI NCCL (v1.17.2-aws) | **1s** | ~500KB | Plugin source |
| **Total** | **~5s** | **~8MB** | Network dependent |

### Phase 2: Build (Estimated from AWS docs)

| Component | Time | CPU Usage | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **NCCL build** | **6-7 min** | 100% (all cores) | Most time-consuming |
| NCCL tests build | 2-3 min | 100% (all cores) | Parallel compilation |
| AWS OFI NCCL build | 1-2 min | 100% (all cores) | Configure + make |
| **Total** | **10-12 min** | **High** | Depends on CPU cores |

**Build Details:**
```bash
# NCCL build command (from postinstall.sh)
make -j src.build NVCC_GENCODE="-gencode=arch=compute_70,code=sm_70 \
                                 -gencode=arch=compute_80,code=sm_80 \
                                 -gencode=arch=compute_90,code=sm_90"

# Builds for 3 GPU architectures:
# - sm_70: V100
# - sm_80: A100
# - sm_90: H100
```

### Phase 3: Installation & Configuration

| Step | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Install libraries | ~30s | Copy to /usr/local/lib |
| Create environment scripts | ~5s | setup-nccl-env.sh |
| Copy test scripts | ~5s | Optional |
| **Total** | **~40s** | Fast |

---

## Total Time by Instance Type

| Instance Type | vCPUs | Estimated Time | Notes |
|---------------|-------|----------------|-------|
| **m5.8xlarge** (HeadNode) | 32 | **10-12 min** | Recommended |
| m5.4xlarge | 16 | 12-15 min | Slower |
| m5.2xlarge | 8 | 15-20 min | Much slower |
| t3.large | 2 | 30-40 min | Not recommended |

**Why HeadNode is fast:**
- m5.8xlarge has 32 vCPUs
- `make -j` uses all cores for parallel compilation
- NCCL build is highly parallelizable

---

## Why NOT Include in CustomActions?

### Problem: WaitCondition Timeout

ParallelCluster CustomActions have a **1-hour timeout** by default:

```
Cluster Creation Timeline:
├─ HeadNode boot: ~2 min
├─ FSx mount: ~5 sec
├─ CustomActions:
│  ├─ CloudWatch Agent: ~1 min
│  ├─ Prometheus: ~2 min
│  ├─ NGC containers (background): ~0 min (doesn't block)
│  └─ NCCL build: ~12 min ← Would add significant delay
└─ cfn-signal: Must complete within 60 min
```

**Current setup (without NCCL):**
- HeadNode ready: ~5 minutes ✅
- ComputeNode ready: ~20 minutes ✅
- Total cluster creation: ~25 minutes ✅

**If NCCL was included:**
- HeadNode ready: ~17 minutes (5 + 12)
- Risk of timeout if other issues occur
- Delays cluster availability

---

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Use NGC Containers (Recommended) ✅

**No NCCL installation needed!**

NGC containers already include optimized NCCL:
- PyTorch 24.01: NCCL 2.19.3
- NeMo 24.01: NCCL 2.19.3 + AWS optimizations

```bash
# Just use the container
srun --container-image=/fsx/containers/nvcr.io_nvidia_pytorch-24.01-py3.sqsh \
     python train.py
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Zero installation time
- ✅ Pre-tested and optimized
- ✅ Includes all dependencies
- ✅ Easy to update (just download new container)

### Option 2: Manual NCCL Installation (If Needed)

**After cluster is created:**

```bash
# SSH to HeadNode
ssh headnode

# Install NCCL to FSx (one-time, 10-12 min)
sudo bash /fsx/nccl/install-nccl-shared.sh v2.28.7-1 v1.17.2-aws /fsx

# Verify
ls -lh /fsx/nccl/
cat /fsx/nccl/.nccl_version
```

**When to use:**
- Need specific NCCL version
- Custom NCCL patches
- Testing NCCL development builds

## Build Time Factors

### What Affects Build Time?

1. **CPU Cores** (most important)
   - More cores = faster parallel compilation
   - m5.8xlarge (32 cores) is ~4× faster than m5.2xlarge (8 cores)

2. **Network Speed**
   - Git clone time: 1-5 seconds
   - Usually negligible

3. **Disk I/O**
   - EBS performance
   - Usually not a bottleneck

4. **CUDA Version**
   - Must be compatible with NCCL version
   - ParallelCluster includes CUDA by default

### Optimization Tips

**If you must build NCCL:**

1. **Use HeadNode** (not ComputeNode)
   - HeadNode has more time before timeout
   - ComputeNode needs to join Slurm quickly

2. **Build for specific architectures only**
   ```bash
   # Only H100 (sm_90)
   make -j src.build NVCC_GENCODE="-gencode=arch=compute_90,code=sm_90"
   # Time: ~3-4 min (instead of 6-7 min)
   ```

3. **Use ccache** (if rebuilding often)
   ```bash
   apt-get install ccache
   export PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH
   ```

## Comparison: NCCL Installation Methods

| Method | Time | Complexity | Maintenance | Recommended |
|--------|------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **NGC Container** | 0 min | Low | Easy | ✅ **Yes** |
| Pre-built binary | 1-2 min | Low | Medium | ⚠️ If available |
| Build from source | 10-15 min | High | Hard | ❌ Only if needed |

## Conclusion

**NCCL installation takes 10-15 minutes** - too long for automatic CustomActions.

**Best practice:**
1. ✅ Use NGC containers (NCCL included, 0 installation time)
2. ⚠️ Manual install to FSx if specific version needed (one-time, 10-15 min)
3. ❌ Don't include in CustomActions (delays cluster creation)

**Current setup is optimal:**
- NGC containers download in background (doesn't block)
- NCCL available immediately via containers
- Manual installation option available if needed
- Fast cluster creation (~25 minutes total)
